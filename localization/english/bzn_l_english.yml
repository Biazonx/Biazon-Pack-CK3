tradition_teulu_name: "Teulu"
tradition_teulu_desc: "The 'teulu' were the personal bodyguard of the Welsh chieftains. They followed a tradition common in other Anglo-Saxon and Germanic societies of the time, whereby close companions and retainers to the lord or king fought alongside him in battle with unwavering loyalty and skill. In this way they are analogous to the hearth companions of the Saxons and the housecarls of the Danes and Anglo-Saxons. Teulu literally means 'family', which implies the close bond they shared with their lord. Riding into battle carrying spears and shields, clad in mail, they were in many ways much like early knights. On the battlefield they were visibly-similar, charging down their enemies with spear or lance in their lord's name."
tradition_irish_cliathairi_name: "Cliathairi"
 tradition_irish_cliathairi_desc: "Cliathairi were the professional "guards" around a king, who formed the backbone of an army in the Gaelic warfare of Medieval Ireland, having chosen military service as a career. These professional soldiers were often employed by landholders as an affordable defense against brigands. When called upon by chieftans or kings during times of war, these soldiers are one of the few units in the Irish army trained in the effective use of the long spear. In battle, they would be accompanied by Ridire - knights of noble Gaelic heritage who were afforded great respect in Irish society. Favouring a light lance and mace, they would fill the niche between light and heavy cavalry."
tradition_hussite_wagon_name: "Hussite Wagon Warfare"
tradition_hussite_wagon_desc: "Born from the fires of religious revolution, the Hussite tradition of wagon warfare transforms humble peasant carts into deadly mobile fortresses. These armored wagons form defensive circles bristling with spears, crossbows, and zealots, turning even a common rabble into a wall of defiance that can repel knights and crusaders alike. Discipline, cooperation, and divine conviction make the war wagon not just a weapon—but a symbol of righteous resistance."

Here, the veil between worlds is thin, and the gods speak through the wind in the oaks, the flight of crows, and the blood spilled beneath the standing stones.
