 #Hidden Grudge
 nht_prowess_offense.0001.t: "Hidden Grudge"
 nht_prowess_offense.0001.opening: "The sun hung low in the sky as I entered the training ground, ready for another day of honing my skills. Among the eager recruits was a young soldier, a face I hadn't seen before. Stepping onto the field, seemingly just another trainee eager to test [duel_opponent.GetHerHis] mettle."
 nht_prowess_offense.0001.hard_fight: "\n\nOur blades clashed, and at first, it seemed like a routine practice duel. However, as the duel progressed, it became evident that something was amiss. [duel_opponent.GetHerHis] strikes transformed from feeble attempts to wild and unrelenting attacks, far beyond what was expected in a training bout. The crowd fell silent, sensing the intensity of the battle."
 nht_prowess_offense.0001.easy_fight: "\n\nOur blades clashed, and at first, it seemed like a routine practice duel. But as the seconds ticked by, it became evident that something was amiss. [duel_opponent.GetHerHis] strikes, while wild and unrelenting, were predictable and easily parried. Nevertheless far beyond what was expected in a training bout, the rage in [duel_opponent.GetHerHis] eyes was an indication it was no common duel."
 nht_prowess_offense.0001.conclusion: "\n\nWith every ounce of skill and experience, I fought to disarm [duel_opponent.GetHerHim], realizing that this had turned into a life-and-death struggle. Finally, [duel_opponent.GetHerHis] sword hit the ground, and the crowd erupted into hushed whispers."
 nht_prowess_offense.0001.a: "I strike [duel_opponent.GetHerHim] down where [duel_opponent.GetSheHe] stands."
 nht_prowess_offense.0001.a.tt: "Decapitation in a single strike is a sure way of making an impression on the footmen — and the nobles — present." 
 nht_prowess_offense.0001.b: "Question him first."
 nht_prowess_offense.0001.b.tt: "I might learn [duel_opponent.GetHerHis] intentions."
 
 nht_prowess_offense.0002.t: "A Soldier's Hidden Agenda"
 nht_prowess_offense.0002.desc: "It doesn't take long to get the truth out of the young soldier. A few days ago the young [duel_opponent.GetWomanMan] enroleed to become a soldier and get close to me, waiting for the right time to take revenge.\n\n[duel_opponent.GetName] explained his story, blaiming his recent misfortune on me, eyes filled with hate. While very young there is cause for execution, at the very least imprisonment, it doesn't seem as if [duel_opponent.GetSheHe] would let the matter go if left unchecked."
 nht_prowess_offense.0002.a: "Execute [duel_opponent.GetHerHim]!"
 nht_prowess_offense.0002.b: "Throw [duel_opponent.GetHerHim] in the dungeon…"

 nht_prowess_offense.0003.desc: "After a long day of training, I sit quietly with several of my knights at a table in a local inn. The smell of wine, the laughter and the music all seem to indicate a good evening, until a [nht_drunk_man.GetWomanMan], I have never seen before, starts to flaunt his prowess, talking about [nht_drunk_man.GetHerHis] wild adventures, and even boasting of knowing the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] of these lands. Clearly, [nht_drunk_man.GetSheHe] doesn't recognise my face. \n\n“I tell you all, I saved [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] from a giant beast with my own hands!, he even offered the hand of [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] daughter, but I refused!”"
 nht_prowess_offense.0003.a: "Another fool."
 nht_prowess_offense.0003.b: "Perhaps I should teach [nht_drunk_man.GetHerHim] a lesson..."

 nht_prowess_offense.0004.t: "A Loud Mouth"
 nht_prowess_offense.0004.desc: "As I walk toward the bar to get another drink, the drunk fool stumble onto me and angrily says.\n\n“Do you know who I am? I can ask for my friend [ROOT.Char.GetName] to teach you a lesson.” \n\nAs the people around looked up at me the room fell silent. Clearly he's not in the right state of mind to call out anyone."
 nht_prowess_offense.0004.a: "“I will let this pass once”"
 nht_prowess_offense.0004.b: "“Maybe you could become a real acquaintance of the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]….”"
 nht_prowess_offense.0004.c: "“A time in locked away will sober [nht_drunk_man.GetHerHim] up...”"

[nht_advice_first_knight.GetName] exhibits admirable footwork and precision, [nht_advice_first_knight.GetHerHis] tendency to telegraph strikes could however be exploited. On the other hand, [nht_advice_second_knight.GetName] occasionally forsakes defense, leaving vulnerabilities exposed in the heat of battle. They are two promising knights with distinct paths for improvement."
 nht_prowess_offense.0005.a: "[nht_advice_first_knight.GetName], refine your feints and unpredictability."
 nht_prowess_offense.0005.a.tt: "[nht_advice_first_knight.GetName] might learn."

 nht_prowess_offense.0006.desc: "Stepping into the grand throne room, I'm met with the unexpected sight of three $knight_culture_player_plural_no_tooltip$ engaged in a fervent argument on which type of sword is best.\n\n[nht_first_knight.GetName], a staunch advocate for cut-and-thrust blades, passionately defends their versatility, emphasizing how these weapons excel in both offensive and defensive maneuvers.\n\n[nht_second_knight.GetName], a proponent of thin cut-centric swords, argues that their precision and speed make them ideal for precise strikes and finesse on the battlefield.\n\nMeanwhile, [nht_third_knight.GetName], a devotee of the longsword, lauds its reach and power, believing it provides the ultimate advantage in combat. The atmosphere crackles with intensity as each knight defends their chosen weapon with unwavering conviction."
 nht_prowess_offense.0006.a: "[nht_first_knight.GetName] is right!"
 nht_prowess_offense.0006.b: "[nht_second_knight.GetName] knows what [nht_second_knight.GetSheHe]'s talking about."

 #Train Knights or Army?
 nht_prowess_offense.0007.t: "One Man's Job"
 nht_prowess_offense.0007.desc: "None can stand long without a strong army. As I watch both my men-at-arms and my knights I see areas of improvements to both but my time is limited.\n\nShould I devote my efforts to the training of our knights, refining their combat skills or is it wiser to focus on bolstering the strength and cohesion of my entire army so that they are well-prepared."
 nht_prowess_offense.0007.a: "The knights will lead the way."
 nht_prowess_offense.0007.b: "It's better to prepare the entire army."

 nht_prowess_offense.0008.desc: "I sit at my desk, pouring over reports of increasing bandit activity in my lands. The situation has grown dire. Several villages have suffered from these marauding outlaws, and it's clear that my control over the region is slipping.\n\nTheir raids have been erratic, finding them would require sending soldiers in every corner of my realm, it would leave me weaker for some time…"

I walk among them, inspecting their quality. Alongside the finely crafted shields stand worn, battle-scarred equipment of yesteryears.\n\nThe equipment surely needs to be replaced but they are also expensive. Very expensive. Each piece of equipment costs a hefty sum of gold, and I have only so much to spare. One or the other could be needed sooner than I think."
