I can feel my neighbors growing restless and so a strategic alliance becomes ever more pressing. Perhaps the ally I need can be found in my realm. \n\nThe air is thick with the scent of wine and the low murmur of conspiring voices in my court. To secure an alliance that could tip the scales of power in my favor."

 nht_prowess_commanding.0003.desc: "As I review the growing pile of military reports and tactical briefings, the weight of my responsibilities as [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName] weighs more heavily each passing days. With wars to wage, defenses to maintain, and soldiers to train, the need for a capable military advisor for strategic planning becomes ever more apparent.\n\nSurely my [marshal.GetTitledFirstName] could take the additional responsibilities. However, recently [nht_trusted_advisor.GetTitledFirstName], known for [nht_trusted_advisor.GetHerHis] strategic acumen, has caught my attention."

In the courtyard, I find [soldier.GetTitledFirstName], one of my more headstrong soldiers, embroiled in a heated dispute with a local commoner, [commoner.GetTitledFirstName]. "This peasant dares to defy my authority!" [soldier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] bellows, while [commoner.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] insists on having been wronged. The rest of my court watches in silence, awaiting my decision."

 nht_prowess_commanding.0005.t: "A Single Form of Victory"
 nht_prowess_commanding.0005.desc: "As I observe my soldiers' training, a singular style of combat is evident across the ranks. Each man moves in a manner so practiced, so precise, yet so predictably the same. Intrigued, I approach the master-at-arms, questioning the lack of variety in their training.\n\n"Why burden the mind with more than it needs to know, my lord?" \n\n[nht_training_commander.GetSheHe] replies with a confidence that borders on arrogance. "One technique, perfected, is all we need to triumph." [nht_corrupt_commander.GetHerHis] words ring with pride, but I can't help but wonder—does victory not demand adaptability?"

 nht_prowess_commanding.0006.desc: "My tour to see my knights takes an unexpected turn upon witnessing the dynamics with [disputed_knight.GetTitledFirstName] and other knights. Commanding with an iron fist, [disputed_knight.GetHeShe] issues orders left and right, the other knights exchange weary glances, their irritation barely concealed. The discontent, it seems, has roots deep enough to trip even the most stalwart horse."
 nht_prowess_commanding.0006.a: "Confront [disputed_knight.GetTitledFirstName] privately about his conduct."
 nht_prowess_commanding.0006.b: "Show [disputed_knight.GetHerHim] true authority."

 nht_prowess_commanding.0006.d: " Make [disputed_knight.GetTitledFirstName] officaly in charge of them."
 
 #Ponder over having better supply for your army
 nht_prowess_commanding.0007.t: "Provisions for the Army"
 nht_prowess_commanding.0007.desc: " As I peruse the ledgers detailing the current supplies of my army, I find myself deep in thought about the supply I provide to my soldiers. The staples of bread and ale have served us well, but an army marches on its stomach, and the quality of their provisions could well determine the morale and vigor of my forces. A constant supply of meat could significantly bolster my army’s strength and spirits but not without cost."
 nht_prowess_commanding.0007.a: "Maintain the current provisions. Our current supplies have served us well."
 nht_prowess_commanding.0007.b: "Invest in securing a steady supply of meat and salt for preservation."

 nht_prowess_commanding.1001.t: "The Righteous Path in War"
 nht_prowess_commanding.1001.islam: "In the quiet of dawn, as the muezzin's call to prayer resonates from the minarets, I am approached by [religious_envoy.GetTitledFirstName], a revered scholar of our faith. \n\n'O [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName],' [religious_envoy.GetSheHe] speaks, [religious_envoy.GetHerHis] words steeped in the wisdom of the Qur'an, 'recall that Allah says, 'Indeed, Allah is with those who fear Him and those who are doers of good.' \n\nOur faith commands righteousness in all actions, especially in the strife of battle. [religious_envoy.GetTitledFirstName] implores me to uphold the virtues of our faith as I lead my armies."\n\n[religious_envoy.GetHerHis] words resonate deeply within me. Warfare is indeed a measure of one's fortitude, but equally a reflection of moral integrity. Can I, in the pursuit of victory, maintain the balance of jihad al-nafs (the struggle of the self) with jihad al-sayf (the struggle of the sword)?"
 nht_prowess_commanding.1001.christianity: "As I make my way through the corridors of my castle, [religious_envoy.GetTitledFirstName], a venerated cleric of our faith, approaches me with a tome in hand. [religious_envoy.GetSheHe] speaks with a voice heavy with the weight of scripture, "My liege, remember the words of our Lord, 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.' In these times of war, it is paramount that you embody the virtues of our Savior. Uphold justice and mercy as you command your armies, for our faith is tested not only in our prayers but also in the throes of battle."\n\n[religious_envoy.GetHerHis] words linger in my mind, a solemn reminder. Warfare tests not only my might but also my spirit. How can I ensure that my actions in war reflect the teachings of Christ and honor [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]?"
 nht_prowess_commanding.1001.judaism: "As the evening shadows lengthen over my court, I find myself in deep conversation with [religious_envoy.GetTitledFirstName], a learned rabbi and respected figure in our faith. [religious_envoy.GetHerHis] eyes, reflecting years of wisdom found in the holy scriptures, meet mine earnestly. "O [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName]," [religious_envoy.GetSheHe] begins, [religious_envoy.GetHerHis] voice tinged with the gravity of ancient teachings, "remember the words of our sages 'Who is mighty? He who conquers his impulses.' As you lead your people in battle, it is not only physical strength that you must exhibit, but also moral strength. Uphold the principles of justice and compassion that our faith cherishes, even in the strife of war."\n\n[religious_envoy.GetHerHis] words linger in my heart. War challenges the body, but the true test is of one's soul. Can I ensure that my conduct in battle upholds the values of our faith ?"
 nht_prowess_commanding.1001.hinduism: "The morning sun casts a golden hue across my chambers as I am visited by [religious_envoy.GetTitledFirstName], a wise and revered man, deeply versed in the knowledge of the faith. [religious_envoy.GetSheHe] greets me with a serene smile and speaks in a voice rich with the wisdom of the Vedas. “My liege, the Bhagavad Gita teaches us that while engaging in war, one must uphold dharma. As a Kshatriya, your duty in war is sacred, but remember, it must be conducted with righteousness and without desire for personal gain." [religious_envoy.GetHerHis] words stir a deep contemplation within me. Warfare is not only a test of physical prowess but also a profound spiritual trial. How can I ensure that my actions in battle are in alignment with dharma, honoring the principles of my faith and [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]?"
 nht_prowess_commanding.1001.fallback: "As I make my way through the corridors of my castle, [religious_envoy.GetTitledFirstName], a respected figure in the faith. "O [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName]," [religious_envoy.GetSheHe] intones with a grave voice, "the path of war is fraught with peril, not just to the body, but to the soul. Our faith demands righteousness in all things, even in the heat of battle. [religious_envoy.GetTitledFirstName] implores me to uphold the virtues of our faith as I lead my armies."\n\n[religious_envoy.GetHerHis] words echo in my mind. War is a test of strength, but also of character. Can I truly wield my sword in righteousness, ensuring my deeds honor [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]?"
 nht_prowess_commanding.1001.a.hinduism: "Duty calls for strength, not introspection. I shall lead as destiny decrees."

 nht_prowess_commanding.1001.d.christianism: "I shall lead with the compassion and justice our Lord teaches."

 nht_prowess_commanding.1002.opening: " As I lay out my grand strategy in the war council, a hushed silence falls over the room. This is shattered when [second_in_command.GetTitledFirstName], my second-in-command, abruptly stands and declares,"
 nht_prowess_commanding.1002.first_alternative: ""A child could have come up with a better strategy." the council fell dead silent, at such open dissent."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1002.second_alternative: ""This strategy is a disaster waiting to happen!" The room erupts in hushed murmurs, shocked by the brazen challenge."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1002.third_alternative: ""your plan is obviously flawed." Murmurs of shock ripple through the room. While I value counsel, such open dissent is rare – and risky."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1002.fourth_alternative: ""With all due respect, I fear there are oversights in your plan." The room fills with a tense whisper, as such disagreement is unexpected."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1002.fifth_alternative: ""With all due respect, my [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], I must object,""
 nht_prowess_commanding.1002.ending: "challenging my plan.\n\nThe council's eyes turn to me, awaiting my response.\n\nAll eyes shift, avoiding mine, except for [second_in_command.GetTitledFirstName]."

 nht_prowess_commanding.1003.desc: "Lately, every whisper in the court seems to sing praises of [neighbor.GetTitledFirstName]'s elite soldiers. Tales of their formidable strength and unmatched prowess in combat have even the most stoic of my knights speaking in hushed, awed tones. Are my own troops adequately prepared?"
 nht_prowess_commanding.1003.a: "Introduce harsher drills for my troops. We will not be outdone!"
 nht_prowess_commanding.1003.a.tt: "Only through rigorous training can excellence be achieved." 
 nht_prowess_commanding.1003.b: "Dismiss the rumors. My army is strong as it is."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1003.b.tt: "Confidence in my own methods is key; there's no need to react to every fairytale."

 nht_prowess_commanding.1004.desc: "During my routine inspection of [nt_weakened_capital.GetTitledFirstName]’s defenses, a subtle yet significant vulnerability catches my eye. Nestled between two towers, a section of the wall, less formidable than the rest, could easily invite disaster. The oversight is troubling; if I've noticed it, surely others have as well. Some of my advisors are advocating for reinforcing the defenses but that would mean less ressource for a possible offensive war."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1004.a: "Strengthen Our Defenses"
 nht_prowess_commanding.1004.b: "I must keep my resources for later use"

 #Hire Foreign as military advisor
 nht_prowess_commanding.1005.t: "A Foreign Mind for Military Matters"
 nht_prowess_commanding.1005.desc: "In my quest to ensure our military remains unmatched, I've entertained the notion of inviting a foreign military advisor to my court. Their expertise in unfamiliar tactics could provide the edge I need on the battlefield. However, whispers of dissent have already begun to spread among my commanders, viewing this as a slight to their capabilities and a threat to their influence. The balance between innovation and tradition is a delicate one."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1005.a: "Welcome the Advisor"

This [inspirational_soldier.GetManWoman], it is said, can turn the tide of despair into a fervent will to push forward. The prospect of such a figure under my command is intriguing, to say the least.

 nht_prowess_commanding.1006.a: "I will visit this soldier and witness [inspirational_soldier.GetHisHer] spirit firsthand."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1006.b: "There's no need to intervene."

Far from mere rumors, the depth of courage, the call to bravery, and the strategic wisdom [inspirational_soldier.GetHeShe] shares resonate deeply.\n\n[inspirational_soldier.GetTitledFirstName]'s eloquence on matters of war and the heartening tales of valor [inspirational_soldier.GetHeShe] recounts not only serve to inspire but also instill a sense of camaraderie. It's clear [inspirational_soldier.GetHeShe] is a rare gem within the ranks."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1007.a: "Commend [inspirational_soldier.GetHisHer] leadership and oratory skills."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1007.b: "Propose to [inspirational_soldier.GetTitledFirstName] to hold regular morale-boosting talks."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1007.c: "[inspirational_soldier.GetSheHe]e can serve me well."

 nht_prowess_commanding.1008.t: "The Pious Inspirer"
 nht_prowess_commanding.1008.desc: "Curious to witness the source of this widespread admiration for [inspirational_soldier.GetTitledFirstName] without the filter of formality or expectation. I blend into the surroundings, the sight that greets me diverges starkly from what I anticipated. Instead of rousing speeches of war and bravery, I find [inspirational_soldier.GetTitledFirstName] in the midst of a humble sermon, [inspirational_soldier.GetHisHer] words steeped in the deep, resonant faith of our people.\n\nThe soldiers gathered around [inspirational_soldier.GetHimHer] listen with a rapt attention that speaks volumes. It is not just bravery that [inspirational_soldier.GetTitledFirstName] inspires but a profound sense of purpose, a calling higher than any battle cry."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1008.a: "Reveal your presence and express your respect for [inspirational_soldier.GetTitledFirstName]."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1008.b: "Maintain your anonymity, allowing [inspirational_soldier.GetTitledFirstName] to continue uninhibited."

 nht_prowess_commanding.1009.desc: "With curiosity guiding my steps, I make my way toward a group of soldiers, where [inspirational_soldier.GetTitledFirstName] is said to be. The reality that unfolds before me is clearly not the tales that have reached my ears.\n\nThe words of [inspirational_soldier.GetTitledFirstName], far from the inspirational rhetoric I was led to expect, are met with thinly veiled smirks and exchanged glances among the soldiers. The air is thick not with admiration, but with sarcasm. It becomes painfully clear that the tales of [inspirational_soldier.GetHisHer] influence were grossly misrepresented, the truth being that [inspirational_soldier.GetHeShe] is more a source of amusement than inspiration, with [inspirational_soldier.GetHisHer] attempts at leadership unwittingly serving as the butt of jokes behind [inspirational_soldier.GetHisHer] back."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1009.a: "I step forward to address the soldiers and defend [inspirational_soldier.GetTitledFirstName]'s honor."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1009.b: "I will mock him with the other soldiers."
 nht_prowess_commanding.1009.c: "Remain silent and withdraw."
