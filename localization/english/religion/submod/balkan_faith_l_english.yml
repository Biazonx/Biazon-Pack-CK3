This Thracian tribe had long settled in the northwest of Anatolia at this time. The Bithynians dedicated an entire month in her honour called Bendideios and is attested on coins issued by Nikomedes I where she is depicted as a warrior goddess holding two javelins.\n\nWorship of Bendis had spread to Athens by the Peloponnesian War. In a festival dedicated to her, the worshippers set out from Athens and Piraeus to sacrifice a pig during the day. During the evening, they held a race on horseback between Athens and Piraeus and passed burning logs among each other. During the night, the worshippers enjoyed a feast that was possibly of an orgiastic nature.#!"
