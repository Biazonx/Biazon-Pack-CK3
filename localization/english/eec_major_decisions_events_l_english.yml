 eec_major_decisions.0001.desc:0 "In the century that followed the Emirate's founding, the Cretan raids continously reached new intensities: their fleets, often commanded by Byzantine renegades, raided the Aegean and further afield, even reaching the Dalmatian coasts. On one occasion c.873 a Cretan fleet even penetrated into the Marmara Sea - the first time since the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople that a Muslim fleet had come so close to the Byzantine capital.\n\nAfter the 890s, the Cretans were joined by North African and Syrian fleets. The impact of this new wave of Arab raids was felt across the Aegean, where some islands were deserted altogether, and elsewhere coastal sites were abandoned for better protected inland locations. The height of Muslim raiding was reached in 904, when a Syrian fleet led by Leo of Tripoli sacked the Byzantine Empire's second city, Thessalonica. The Arabs of Crete co-operated closely with their Syrian counterparts, who often used Crete as a base or a stop-over, as during the return of Leo of Tripoli's fleet from Thessalonica, when many of the over 20,000 Thessalonian captives were sold or gifted as slaves in Crete.\n\nThe depictions of Crete itself under the Emirate differs greatly by source. Contemporary Byzantine sources have traditionally viewed the Emirate of Crete as a quintessential 'corsair's nest', surviving on piracy and the slave trade. The picture painted by the few and scattered references from the Muslim world, on the other hand, is of an ordered state with a regular monetary economy and extensive trade links, and there is evidence that Chandax was a cultural centre of some importance. The survival of numerous gold, silver, and copper coins, of almost constant weight and composition, testifies to a strong economy and a high living standard among the population. The economy was strengthened by extensive trade with the rest of the Muslim world, especially with Egypt, and by a booming agriculture as the need to sustain an independent state, as well as access to the markets of the Muslim world, led to an intensification of cultivation."

 eec_major_decisions.0002.desc:0 "Since the conquest of Crete by Andalusian exiles, the Aegean sea has been enbroiled in a constant struggle for control between the Byzantine and Muslim fleets. The attempts to retake Crete in 827-828 under Emperor Michael II ended in sucessive failures. In 843,  another expedition to recover Crete was launched under the personal leadership of the powerful logothetes and regent Theoktistos. Although it succeeded in occupying much of the island, Theoktistos had to abandon the army due to political intrigues in Constantinople, and the troops left behind were slaughtered by the Arabs. Despite some Byzantine successes against the Arabs in the following years, the Cretans resumed their raids in the early 860s, attacking the Peloponnese, the Cyclades, and Athos. In 866, the Byzantine Caesar Bardas assembled another large-scale expeditionary force to subdue Crete, but his murder only two weeks after the fleet set sail from the capital spelled the end of the undertaking.\n\nHistorically, in the early 870s, the Cretan raids reached a new intensity as their fleets raided the Aegean and further afield, reaching the Dalmatian coasts and even penetrating into the Marmara Sea - the first time in 150 years that a Muslim fleet had come so close to the Byzantine capital.\n\nCretan fleets did suffer several defeats at the hands of the new Byzantine admiral, Niketas Ooryphas, at the Battle of Kardia and at the Gulf of Corinth. At about the same time, the Muslim fleet of Tarsus led by Yazaman al-Khadim was destroyed in a raid against Euripos. These Byzantine victories apparently led to a temporary truce.\n\nThis peace would not last long, with raids resumed soon after, in which the Cretans were joined by North African and Syrian fleets. The Cretans gained control of several Aegean islands, and eventually, in 904, a Syrian fleet sacked the Byzantine Empire's second city, Thessalonica.\n\nThe end of the Emirate finally came during the reign of Romanos II, (r. 959–963), who entrusted the task to the capable general Nikephoros Phokas. At the head of a huge fleet and army, Phokas sailed in June or July 960, landed on the island, and defeated the initial Muslim resistance. A long siege of Chandax followed, which dragged over the winter into 961, when the city was stormed on 6 March. The city was pillaged, and its mosques and walls were torn down. Muslim inhabitants were either killed or carried off into slavery, while the island's last emir Abd al-Aziz ibn Shu'ayb (Kouroupas) and his son al-Numan (Anemas) were taken captive and brought to Constantinople, where Phokas celebrated a triumph. The island was converted into a Byzantine theme, and the remaining Muslims were converted to Christianity by missionaries like Nikon "the Metanoeite".\n\nHowever no one knows what this future will hold. Will the Emirate raise to be a defining threat to the Empire or fade away into obscurity?"
