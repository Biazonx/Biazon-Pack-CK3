 Pierre: "Pierre"
 historical_character.pierre_valdes: "#EMP Pierre Valdès#! was a wealthy merchant of Lyon who, struck by a profound religious awakening, renounced his possessions and devoted his life to the preaching of apostolic poverty. Inspired by the teachings of Christ and the early Church, he translated scripture into the vernacular so that all might hear the Word of God. His followers, later known as the Waldensians, challenged ecclesiastical authority by preaching without clerical sanction, drawing condemnation from the Catholic hierarchy. Declared heretical, Pierre’s movement endured persecution yet survived in the valleys and towns of Europe, becoming one of the earliest expressions of lay reform that would echo centuries later in the Reformation. \n @profession_theology! \n"

They do not seek converts, nor do they challenge the Son of Heaven, yet their devotion to Truth and Order is unwavering.
