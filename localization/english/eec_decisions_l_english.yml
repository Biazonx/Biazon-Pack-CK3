 elevate_crete_decision_desc:0 "The Emirate of Crete was a Muslim state that existed on the Mediterranean island of Crete from the late 820s to the reconquest of the island by the Byzantine Empire in 961. The emirate was founded by a group of Andalusian exiles led by Abu Hafs Umar al-Iqritishi who conquered Crete sometime c.824-828 and established an independent Islamic state, although the island still recognized the suzerainty of the Abbasid Caliphate and maintained close ties with Tulunid Egypt despite this independence. The conquest of the island was of major regional importance as it transformed the naval balance of power in the Eastern Mediterranean and opened the hitherto secure Aegean Sea littoral to frequent and devastating Muslim raids."
