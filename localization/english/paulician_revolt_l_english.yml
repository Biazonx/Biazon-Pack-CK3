 great_project_type_paulician_heresy_desc: "Winning the war against Chrysocheir is only the beginning. The Paulician heresy has poisoned the eastern themes for generations, and simply killing its soldiers will not kill the idea. This grand project represents a systematic effort to permanently eradicate the heresy from our lands, using every tool at the Empire's disposal: the sword, the coin, and the Cross. We will not only defeat the heretics, we will uproot their entire society."

This contribution establishes a 'discretionary fund' used to bribe these lesser leaders with gold, titles, and land in exchange for turning against their heresiarch. We will break their rebellion from within."

This contribution organizes the difficult but necessary task of 'metanastasis'- the forced resettlement of captured or surrendered Paulician clans. By transplanting them to distant lands like Thrace or the Peloponnese, we will shatter their enclaves, sever their roots, and dilute their faith amongst the Orthodox populace."

This contribution provides engineers and materials for a chain of new forts and watchtowers across the former heretic heartlands.

 paulician_revolt.0001.t: "The Heresy of Tephrice"
 paulician_revolt.0001.desc: "An urgent dispatch arrives from the Strategos of the Sebasteia Theme, his seal heavy with dread. A rebellion, festering for years on the Empire's eastern fringes, has erupted into open war.\n\nA charismatic and ruthless heresiarch named Chrysocheir has done the unthinkable. From the mountain fortress of Tephrike, he has proclaimed an independent Paulician State and declared himself its protector. His host, fighting under black banners, has now poured across the frontier to 'liberate' the surrounding lands for his followers.\n\nThese are no mere rebels. They are adherents to the Paulician heresy, a vile dualist creed that scorns the Holy Cross, spits upon our sacred icons, and rejects the established Church. They preach of a corrupt, evil god who created the material world, and a distant, good god who remains separate from it.\n\nDecades ago, the pious Empress Theodora sought to purge this cancer from the Empire. The Paulicians were driven from their homes, their leaders executed. But they did not vanish. They fled into the lawless eastern borderlands, nursing a deep and venomous hatred for the Empire that persecuted them. Chrysocheir is the heir to that hatred, and he has returned to carve out a permanent home for his people from our lands.\n\nThis is not a simple raid - it is a holy war for the soul of Anatolia."

 paulician_revolt.0002.desc: "An entry in the Imperial intelligence ledger notes the success of a recent operation. A significant contribution of funds, designated for covert actions against eastern heretics, was received and acknowledged via a private channel. The funds have reportedly been disbursed to turn key figures within the heretic leadership against each other, exacerbating internal conflicts. The source of the funds was formally praised in the exchange for their 'subtle and effective' methods."
 paulician_revolt.0002.a: "A house divided against itself cannot stand."

 paulician_revolt.0003.t: "A Difficult Task"
 paulician_revolt.0003.desc: "I have received thanks from the governors in the East for assisting in the difficult logistics of the population transfers. While a grim task, it is seen as a necessary one to ensure the long-term stability of the region and prevent the heresy from festering again. My dedication to this unpleasant but vital work is appreciated."

My contribution, I am told, has been instrumental in providing the Church with the resources it needs to confront the Paulician heretics directly and bring the light of true faith back to those lost lands. My piety has been duly noted."

 paulician_revolt.0006.desc: "Victory is total. The grand project to pacify the eastern themes is complete. The fortress of Tephrice, once the heart of a vile heresy, is now a loyal Imperial garrison. The Paulician leaders are dead or scattered, their followers converted or resettled in distant lands. A new chain of forts watches over a populace that is slowly but surely returning to the Orthodox fold. The cancer of heresy has been cut out, and the soul of Anatolia is once again secure."

 paulician_revolt.0007.desc: "The ambitious project to pacify the east has failed. The war may be over, but the heresy remains, now more defiant than ever. Our efforts to convert, bribe, and resettle the Paulicians were insufficient, and their communities have weathered the storm. Though their state has been broken, their faith endures, a permanent source of instability and rebellion on our frontier. We have shown our hand, and we have lost. The heretics of the east remain a thorn in the side of the Empire."

paulician_revolt.0008.t: "The Future of the Paulicians"
paulician_revolt.0008.desc: "The fires of rebellion have burned across Anatolia, and the Paulician banners now stand where once imperial standards flew. Yet independence is a fragile thing in the shadow of Constantinople.\n\nThe Emperor watches. His court whispers. His generals sharpen their swords.\n\nWe may stand alone and dare him to reclaim what was lost… or we may bend the knee just enough to secure our survival — offering tribute in gold rather than blood."
